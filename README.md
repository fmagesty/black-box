## TODO:

- priority: refactor app for scalability before adding more news sources
- priority: fix how RenderNewsCard is rendering the image on the card when there is no image available from source

- create more tests
- add other news sources
- ~~Header containing links to homepage and other pages~~
- ~~CSS of news cards~~ (done for prototype)
- Info about install/run/deploy/contribute/etc on this README
- filter the news based on the person's location. for now I'm fetching from the frontpage so it gets news from different states
- eslint/prettier config with airbnb - already have eslint default
- dotenv when necesarry - which it'll be eventually
- add material ui - MUI - so that my project isnt the ugly blob it always is xD - at least chaptGPT did good on the color pallete
- search input for keywords and to search news by a date/timeframe
